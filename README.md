Domain-Driven Design - working with legacy projects (Work in progress)

### Branches

- [Initial](https://github.com/Lidiadev/ddd-legacy-project/tree/intial) - the `initial` branch contains the legacy project.
- Master - the `master` branch will contain the code after refactoring. 

The sample project is a **Package Delivery System** which keeps track of packages for delivery with the following features:
- create delivery: select customer and address
- edit package: select products
- send package to customer.

The Package Delivery System is a desktop application written in WPF. It uses Dapper to execute SQL queries.
